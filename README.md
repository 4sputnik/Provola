# Provola#

little software that looks for T1-3D MRI dicoms in a folder, 
transofrms them to nifit, reoriens them and finally 
converts into .mgz that are sent in a separate folder.

-provola20 is set for a fixed folder depth=3

-evoprovola works on any depth and the search is customizable,
 but the dicom header must be well characterized 

-todo: poter dare le ricerche come input da terminale
