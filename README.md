# Provola#

little bash script that looks for T1-3D MRI dicoms in a folder, 
transofrms them to nifti, reorients them and finally 
converts into .mgz that are sent in a separate folder.

-provola20.sh is set for a fixed folder depth=3.

-evo_provola.sh works on any depth and the search is customizable,
 but the dicom header must be well characterized. 

-todo: poter dare le ricerche come input da terminale
